# Make Your Game

This repository contains several sub-projects developed as part of the "Make Your Game" project at Notre Dame. Each folder is a self-contained sub-project, with its own code, assets, and documentation.

> **Note:**  
> During our time at Notre Dame, we used Gitea for version control. Each sub-project was maintained in a separate private repository, and we could not control the visibility settings. As a result, the commit history here does not reflect our actual contributions.
